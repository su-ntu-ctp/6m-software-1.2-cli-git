    <h3 class="myaboutme">More about me:</h3>
    <div>
      <p class="myaboutme">
        For the past 5 years, I have been researching on cancer. <br />Although
        researching on cancer on the laboratory bench is important for the
        advancement of cures, diagnosis and treatment of cancer;
        <br />programmes or applications that will assist in this advancement
        are equally important. <br />My immediate goals after completion of the
        course is to further upskill and create a programme or digital product
        to aid in the cancer research or science in general.
