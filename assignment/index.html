        <p>My name is Karen and I am from Singapore <img class="sgflag" src="./img/sgflag.png" />. 
            <br>Currently, I am playing <strong> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bestgamingvideostiktok/video/7233445446377590059"> Zelda Tears of the Kingdom </strong> </a> on the Nintendo Switch. You get to do cool things like build destructive robots and ride on glowing dragons. I can't imagine why anyone would want to do anything else. </p>
            <p>Here are some of my other interests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bouldering</li>
            <li>Calisthenics</li>
            <li>Movies</li>
            <li>Poetry, theatre, reading most things with words</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In my free time, I like learning new things and I especially enjoy exploring new areas related to movement. I just started picking up contemporary dance as it marries strength, flexibility, and grace, with creative expression. To the ire of my neighbours, I would eventually like to learn the drums in future. </p>
